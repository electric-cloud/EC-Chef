<detailedDescription>Chef is an open-source, systems integration framework built specifically for automating the cloud, making it easy to deploy servers and scale applications throughout your entire infrastructure.
The EC-Cher plugin interacts with the Chef shell through the Chef commander agent, allowing you to perform several key functions, such as:

* Download Cookbooks from the Chef repository to the local node.
* Install Cookbooks on local nodes (with Git).
* Uploaded Cookbooks from the local node to the Chef server.
* Add Recipes to a node run-list.
* Configuration defined on a node run-list can be applied to a node.</detailedDescription>
